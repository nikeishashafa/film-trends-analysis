## ⚙️ Steps in the Project
1. **Extract dataset** → unzip raw data.  
2. **Initial inspection** → check dataset structure.  
3. **Data cleaning** → fix missing values & inconsistent data.  
4. **Numeric cleaning** → handle budget, revenue, runtime, etc.  
5. **Genres processing** → extract & analyze genres.  
6. **Credits parsing** → get director and main cast.  
7. **Feature engineering** → add profit, ROI, is_hit, etc.  
8. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → explore trends, distributions, top genres/directors.  
9. **Visualization** → plots & charts for insights.  
10. **Save processed data** → export clean dataset.  
11. **Conclusion & next steps** → summarize insights & suggest improvements.
